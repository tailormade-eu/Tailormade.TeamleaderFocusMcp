## Known API Quirks (documented)

| Endpoint | Quirk |
|----------|-------|
| `projectLines.list` | `project_id` top-level in body, NOT inside `filter` |
| `projectLines.list` | `project_group_id` NOT a server filter — must filter client-side on `l.group?.id` |
| `tasks.list` | status filter is client-side only |
| `tasks.create` | use `group_id` not `project_group_id` |
| `timeTracking.list` | returns `subject.type: "todo"` — ID differs from `nextgenTask` ID |
| `timeTracking.add` | strip milliseconds: `.replace(/\.\d+Z$/, "+00:00")` |

## Known Bugs

### ✅ BUG-01: log_time task_id after tree invalidation — FIXED (v1.3.1)
**Status:** Fixed (03/03/2026)
**Symptom (old):** After `task_action` invalidates tree → `log_time` with `task_id` returned success but entry was 404.
**Root cause:** Silent API acceptance without verification.
**Fix:** Added `timeTracking.info` verification after `timeTracking.add`. If entry not found → clear error with body sent + force_refresh suggestion.
**Verified:** task_action create → log_time task_id → timeTracking.info ✅ entry exists.

## Priority Testing Queue

1. `task_action move_time` — BUG-01 fixed, unblock this
2. `log_time` Tree fallback (scoreTasksInTree) + confirm_task_match
3. `task_action close` via task_number (needs fresh tree)
4. `load_tasks` only_open=false + force_refresh
5. `teamleader_find_task` — full flow (cache miss → group → task)
