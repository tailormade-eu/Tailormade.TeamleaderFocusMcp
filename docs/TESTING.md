## Known API Quirks (documented)

| Endpoint | Quirk |
|----------|-------|
| `projectLines.list` | `project_id` top-level in body, NOT inside `filter` |
| `projectLines.list` | `project_group_id` NOT a server filter — must filter client-side on `l.group?.id` |
| `tasks.list` | status filter is client-side only |
| `tasks.create` | use `group_id` not `project_group_id` |
| `timeTracking.list` | returns `subject.type: "todo"` — ID differs from `nextgenTask` ID |
| `timeTracking.add` | strip milliseconds: `.replace(/\.\d+Z$/, "+00:00")` |
| `projects-v2/projects.create` | Created project has status `"open"` (not `"active"`) |
| `projects-v2/projectLines.create` | Does NOT exist — was wrong endpoint. Use `projectGroups.create` for groups and `tasks.create` for tasks |
| `projects-v2/projectGroups.delete` | Requires `delete_strategy` param: `"ungroup_tasks_and_materials"` or `"delete_tasks_and_materials"` |

## Known Bugs

### ✅ BUG-01: log_time task_id after tree invalidation — FIXED (v1.3.1)
**Status:** Fixed (03/03/2026)
**Symptom (old):** After `task_action` invalidates tree → `log_time` with `task_id` returned success but entry was 404.
**Root cause:** Silent API acceptance without verification.
**Fix:** Added `timeTracking.info` verification after `timeTracking.add`. If entry not found → clear error with body sent + force_refresh suggestion.
**Verified:** task_action create → log_time task_id → timeTracking.info ✅ entry exists.
