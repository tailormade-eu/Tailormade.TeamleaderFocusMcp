## Known API Quirks (documented)

| Endpoint | Quirk |
|----------|-------|
| `projectLines.list` | `project_id` top-level in body, NOT inside `filter` |
| `projectLines.list` | `project_group_id` NOT a server filter — must filter client-side on `l.group?.id` |
| `tasks.list` | status filter is client-side only |
| `tasks.create` | use `group_id` not `project_group_id` |
| `timeTracking.list` | returns `subject.type: "todo"` — ID differs from `nextgenTask` ID |
| `timeTracking.add` | strip milliseconds: `.replace(/\.\d+Z$/, "+00:00")` |
| `timeTracking.list` | `filter.started_after` / `filter.started_before` accept **date only** (`YYYY-MM-DD`) — datetime strings cause 400 |
| `timeTracking.update` | No partial updates for time fields — always send `started_at` + `ended_at` together |
| `projects-v2/projects.create` | Created project has status `"open"` (not `"active"`) |
| `projects-v2/projectLines.create` | Does NOT exist — was wrong endpoint. Use `projectGroups.create` for groups and `tasks.create` for tasks |
| `projects-v2/projectGroups.create` | Use `start_date` / `end_date` (NOT `starts_on` / `due_on`) |
| `projects-v2/projectGroups.update` | Uses `start_date`/`end_date` (not `starts_on`/`due_on`) |
| `projects-v2/projectGroups.delete` | Requires `delete_strategy` param: `"ungroup_tasks_and_materials"` or `"delete_tasks_and_materials"` |
| `projects.close` | Requires `closing_strategy` param: `"mark_tasks_and_materials_as_done"` or `"none"` |
| `projects.delete` | Requires `delete_strategy` param: `"unlink_tasks_and_time_trackings"` or `"delete_tasks_and_time_trackings"` |
| `projects.assign` | Uses `assignee: {type, id}` object (not flat ID) |
| `projects.addCustomer` | Uses `customer: {type, id}` object (not flat ID) |
| `subscriptions.list` | Uses `billing_cycle.periodicity.{unit,period}` + `days_in_advance` (NOT `renewal_period`) |
| `subscriptions.list` | `next_renewal_date` (not `next_renewal_on`); no customer filter → filter client-side on `invoicee.customer.id` |
| `subscriptions.info` | `unit_price.tax: "excluding"` in line_items (string, NOT currency field) — same as invoices.creditPartially |
| `subscriptions.info` | Tax field in line_items = `{type: "taxRate", id: "..."}` (not flat `tax_rate_id`) |
| `subscriptions.update` | `note: ""` (empty string) → 400 "must not be empty" — use `null` to clear |
| `subscriptions.deactivate` | Idempotent — deactivating already-deactivated subscription returns success |
| `invoices.registerPayment` | Uses `paid_at` (not `payment_date`), nested `payment` object (not flat params) |
| `invoices.creditPartially` | `unit_price.tax: "excluding"` (not a currency field) |
| `tickets.list` | Customer filter = `relates_to: {type, id}`, status filter = `exclude.status_ids` array |
| `files.upload` | Two-step: get pre-signed URL via API, then binary POST to that URL (no auth needed) |
| `quotations.accept` | Returns 204 No Content (not the updated quotation) |
| `quotations.create` | Requires `deal_id`; needs `grouped_lines` and/or `text` to be valid |
| `quotations.create` | `unit_price.tax: "excluding"` (same pattern as invoices/subscriptions) |
| `quotations.create` | `discount.type` only supports `"percentage"` (values 0-100) |
| `creditNotes.sendViaPeppol` | Returns 204 No Content; customer must have Peppol ID configured |
| `materials.assign` | Uses `assignee: {type, id}` object (same pattern as projects.assign) |
| `materials.assign` | Returns 204 No Content |

## Known Bugs

### ✅ BUG-01: log_time task_id after tree invalidation — FIXED (v1.3.1)
**Status:** Fixed (03/03/2026)
**Symptom (old):** After `task_action` invalidates tree → `log_time` with `task_id` returned success but entry was 404.
**Root cause:** Silent API acceptance without verification.
**Fix:** Added `timeTracking.info` verification after `timeTracking.add`. If entry not found → clear error with body sent + force_refresh suggestion.
**Verified:** task_action create → log_time task_id → timeTracking.info ✅ entry exists.
